The EnronSent corpus is a special preparation of a portion of the Enron Email Dataset designed specifically for use in Corpus Linguistics and language analysis.  It contains 96,107 messages from the "Sent Mail" directories of all the users in the corpus. It has been cleaned specifically for use with conventional corpus linguistics tools, and an attempt has been made to remove as much non-human generated text as possible from the raw messages in the original data.
